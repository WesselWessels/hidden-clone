# Hidden Clone

This is a clone of the amazing game [Hidden in Plain Sight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/303590/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight/).

I played this at a friend on his Nintendo Switch and wanted to buy it on my own, but due to some issue on my account I couldn't and decided to write my own.

This is my first animated game, so there may be some silly things I did.

I used these cool assets from [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/toon-characters-1).

There is still a lot to do:

* Customizable controls (potentially bluetooth controller)
* Player amount customization
* Show winner
* End game state (incl. timer)
